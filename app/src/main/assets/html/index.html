    <strong> Scanning:</strong> <br />
    Scanning included long pressing period of change of frequency for 3 seconds during this
    time included the cost of sending a command to the module radio. <br />

    you can identify by ear - be careful when choosing the interval. <br />
    Deactivated by pressing the frequency (frequency input field) - scanning frequency and buttons
    change the channel when scanning channels. <br /> To program scanned in the background
    (with the screen off) it is necessary to curtail the button "home" and only then turn off the
    screen. <br />
    That the program scanned the "RX tone" - the settings put a check in front of "RX tone." <br />

    which is set in the settings. <br /> Button toggles with the dynamics of "Speaker" and "Headset"
    - if not just the sound of the headset from the radio turned off (only Runbo). <br />
    Volume is controlled by the slider - but very weak (thanks for the Chinese curve diagram) so
    that it is better to set the minimum. <br /> The screen is only portrait - to make it easier. <br />
